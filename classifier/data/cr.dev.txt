1 ||| the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .
1 ||| it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
1 ||| - great sound ! . i was very impressed , i encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great , especially with the better headphones .
1 ||| overall it is the best camera on the market .
0 ||| also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4 . 99 / mo . ) never works .
1 ||| this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n 't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
1 ||| just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date .
0 ||| the flash is very weak .
0 ||| you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
0 ||| they have the worst service of any of the major companies .
0 ||| finally , after about a week 's use , the screen started to freeze on me .
1 ||| sound : this is where i love zen the most .
1 ||| it is small .
0 ||| cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .
1 ||| i have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode , while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera , its quality easily surpasses that of my old hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe ( max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card ) .
0 ||| and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .
1 ||| the extra gb of hard rive space , remove able battery and fm tuner , as well as the fact that i was previously a satisfied owner of the nomad ii put it over the top for me .
0 ||| i tried disabling the various components provided with this product , paring it all the way back to anti-virus only service . . . and saw no improvement .
1 ||| however after playing with it for three weeks now , i 'm convinced , the zen micro is superior .
1 ||| all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .
1 ||| i have only used it with the 1/4 " collet and a 1/2 " round over bit , but i love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly .
0 ||| there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .
0 ||| creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n 't as easy as i would have liked .
1 ||| using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient .
0 ||| e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage
1 ||| this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
1 ||| while i would like to give it 3 . 5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it .
1 ||| there are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be text ed to you at no cost .
1 ||| speaking of battery , it 's removable and replaceable ! .
0 ||| first , let me say that i got the 20gb ipod for christmas , and i most likely would not have spent the $300 myself .
1 ||| the menus are very easy to navigate .
0 ||| crappy headphones .
1 ||| you can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it .
1 ||| the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .
0 ||| b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens ti gt and cause potential damage .
0 ||| i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment .
1 ||| i 've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and i truely love it .
1 ||| if i had to do it over , i wouldn 't buy anything else .
1 ||| the storage capacity is great .
0 ||| after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .
0 ||| i finally got a free support number for norton through my usp support staff , but waited an hour or more for a voice .
1 ||| the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
1 ||| 4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; . cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worth wile at the price .
0 ||| yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .
0 ||| this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n 't purchase it .
1 ||| it 's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though i haven 't had to do it yet of course .
1 ||| i must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held .
0 ||| also , for those that complain that the diaper champ isn 't as effective as time passes , keep the following in mind : as babies get older , their diets changes ( aka solid foods ! . ) and so does the smell of their diapers ! .
1 ||| i also like the fact that you can edit your mp3 titles , etc .
0 ||| only one disk played through to completion successfully .
0 ||| i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .
0 ||| also if you do manage to get it installed , any problems with liveupdate or with system works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating internet security .
1 ||| i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips , i give it 5/5 stars = ) oh and btw , while you take video clips , you can zoom it too ! . ( digital zoom only though ) . . . but still . . . ( my old one can 't do that . . . you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip . )
1 ||| just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
1 ||| also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .
0 ||| 5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .
0 ||| the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .
1 ||| it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video .
1 ||| the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
1 ||| among my requirements for a phone were : good screen , decent camera , bluetooth , and gprs support .
0 ||| the price is $ . . . more .
1 ||| even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .
1 ||| i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .
0 ||| mediasource did not recognize my tags ! .
0 ||| the cons are n 't really a big deal to me . . . except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files . . . no folder structure . . . and it 's based on the title of the songs . . . many of my songs where separated into folders ( on the pc ) . . . and a few had same titles . . . so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n 't have any that might be the same as another .
1 ||| sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
1 ||| the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate .
1 ||| this is a well-made and powerful tool .
1 ||| travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket
1 ||| way less expensive than the ipod .
0 ||| it 's as though nokia has segregated 90% of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10% for the day to day use .
1 ||| 12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) ! .
1 ||| it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .
1 ||| for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
1 ||| i am happy with the fact that i can use any bag in there and dont ' have to pay out the nose for replacements .
0 ||| finally , i gave up and i purchased a router racier .
1 ||| despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc . .
1 ||| first , it really is tiny ; . the size of a pack of cigarettes , maybe a scotch deeper .
1 ||| the router has plenty of power for any type of bit or wood i need to cut , and the speed control knob is easy to get to .
1 ||| the earbuds are great headphones as good as my ak studio 240 , well not as good but darn close .
1 ||| however , the battery life is good enough you should n 't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .
0 ||| the only thing i don 't like is the small size ( 8 meg ) memory card that comes with it .
1 ||| it 's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn 't have clumsy and confusing ( not to mention expensive ) refills .
1 ||| this camera is truely superb .
1 ||| the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
0 ||| wo n 't play a lot of discs .
1 ||| after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace , i decided on the s100 .
1 ||| this is an excellent router for the money .
0 ||| it is some protection for the unit , but for use ability , forget it .
1 ||| because this camera is beautiful .
1 ||| i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy .
1 ||| getting files onto it is quick and painless .
1 ||| now he res the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equalizer type deals on here .
0 ||| unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .
1 ||| all in all , this is a wonderful device .
0 ||| its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily , not great from a cosmetic standpoint .
1 ||| the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing ! .
1 ||| i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my apple power book ! .
1 ||| this phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard .
0 ||| 4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .
0 ||| in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .
1 ||| the camera is a dream to operate in auto mode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .
1 ||| it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
0 ||| i 've read about the issues with the scroll bar , but they must have taken care of that now .
1 ||| transfering mp3s are a cinch with the included software .
0 ||| 3 ) the lack of an intermediate resolution setting , as other reviewers have suggested , is a problem , but that problem is meaningless with a larger compactflash memory card
0 ||| not a killer problem , but not well done , either .
0 ||| the touch sarene navigation will take a little getting used to , but once you do , and while the zen is still alive , it 's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies .
1 ||| i give this product five stars for its usability , performance , expandability , and definitely looks ! .
1 ||| the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .
0 ||| while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .
0 ||| when i finally got it working , it only worked properly for many a month .
1 ||| its nice look is also a plus .
0 ||| i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .
0 ||| i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .
0 ||| it was a symantec error .
0 ||| * eax equalizer accentuates diminished quality of mp3 files .
1 ||| pros : - excellent sound , even with the headphones that come out of the box , but it absolutely rocked with my bose quiet comfort 2 set .
1 ||| the ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from jobs and company .
1 ||| when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n 't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .
0 ||| no memory stick slots -- although a rare feature , it would be nice to have extra storage , not that it needs it built-in lithium battery -- a huge hassle to bring this back ; . draining the battery once you get it helps , but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient
0 ||| . this camera keeps on outfoxing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .
0 ||| the support has been less than impressive , considering the cost .
0 ||| what i dont like : nothing much except headphones , belt clip design .
1 ||| i would however highly recommend the m12v router ! .
1 ||| on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
1 ||| this camera takes amazing pictures and its size can not be beat .
1 ||| the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone " unlike the nokia 3650 " and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make . . .
1 ||| the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .
1 ||| after getting one for christmas from amazon , i 'm now a believer : the digital elph is truly the world 's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures .
1 ||| the battery life is less than stellar , but it charges w/ the quickness .
1 ||| with bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long .
1 ||| i take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice .
0 ||| other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as i 'd like them ,
1 ||| all in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment .
1 ||| if anyone is thinking of getting an ipod mini , forget it and go with this player .
1 ||| if i had to do it over again , even with the cost savings of using any type of bag , i would go w/ the diaper genie .
0 ||| also , the lens cap design is flawed .
1 ||| the moveable lcd screen is great .
0 ||| these people takes lest effort to process rebate forms .
1 ||| this is the fourth version of systemworks and the second version of internet security that i have used and it has always been a favorite .
1 ||| speaker phone quality is good , and poping in a 512mb mmc card , it rocks ! .
0 ||| i 'm an advocate of nokia , but this phone and the following models ( 7610 ) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .
1 ||| get it , it 's woth every penny ! . ! .
1 ||| operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie levitt's , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .
1 ||| proven canon built quality and lens .
0 ||| if this machine just stops on you , unplug it quickly and get out of the way ! .
1 ||| and it 's the largest diaper pail i 've seen without taking up more floor space .
1 ||| also , multiple picture feature is very , very fast .
1 ||| it may not top the ipod mini , but it 's definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality .
1 ||| other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won 't disappoint any already established nokia phone fans .
1 ||| the zen micro is near perfect .
1 ||| a few of my work constituents owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .
0 ||| -- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library .
1 ||| this item is exceptional i like the ease of use and it held the odor in great .
0 ||| but those 2 come up every time .
0 ||| i 've since replaced it with a pair of black sennheisers . . . not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable , but are too similar to ipod 's and can target ipod thieves here in nyc .
1 ||| as for itunes , i don 't find it to be as good as the windows media player as a computer mp3 player , but it is good enough .
1 ||| i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .
1 ||| works pretty well .
0 ||| when i purchase software , i never want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry ! .
1 ||| it 's faster than wmp .
1 ||| i loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and , very importantly , the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous .
0 ||| we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but can not be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .
0 ||| even on the low sensitive level , a slight touch can skip or pause the track .
0 ||| 1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .
1 ||| you indefinitely appreciate the small size .
1 ||| at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .
1 ||| the setup and transfer process was cake for me .
1 ||| you don 't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a " special edition " to get black ! . - sound : awesome ! . - batteries : removable/replaceable .
0 ||| customer service and technical support are overloaded and non responsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them .
1 ||| fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the met 60 ct-4 .
1 ||| in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
0 ||| if you experience problems with installation , you can visit symantec 's website , click the support tab , click the 'home or home office support ' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it .
0 ||| - not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .
1 ||| the light auto-correction is awesome .
0 ||| output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .
1 ||| purchased this router a few months back , no problems whatsoever .
1 ||| great phone . . .
0 ||| my daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor .
1 ||| it holds almost a week 's worth of diapers , and you don 't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work .
1 ||| the camera is as easy to use as a point and shoot , and with instant review on the lcd screen , you can retake any flubbed shots on the spot .
0 ||| they obviously have quality and reliability problems .
1 ||| at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support .
1 ||| i do not count this as a negative , however , because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up ! . ! . ! .
0 ||| then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not .
1 ||| further , the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the ipod .
1 ||| player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .
1 ||| creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean .
1 ||| another 5 star performance .
0 ||| who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a " foreign " computer just to move over some simple ( * . txt ) files ? .
1 ||| it came with a good fence that is simple yet precise and thats well made and won 't break .
1 ||| it hasn't gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ) .
0 ||| i tried called apex cu st service , no help .
1 ||| i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
1 ||| the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .
1 ||| great features . . .
0 ||| the touch pad does take a little getting used to .
1 ||| im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button ! .
1 ||| i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites .
0 ||| i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n 't a big problem .
1 ||| i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine .
0 ||| i tried it again this morning and it said i didn 't have the required " permissions " and lacked proper administrator status .
1 ||| for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison .
1 ||| it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .
1 ||| the base was deeper and the highs were crisper .
0 ||| the flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to .
1 ||| for the price and features it is really good .
1 ||| it 's overkill for simple snapshots , unless you 've got way too much money to blow .
0 ||| well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) .
1 ||| the height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy , but it works well and provides good accuracy .
1 ||| so the pretty solid router all around good for the money here 's the link to firmware updates http : //www . suavest . com/forum6 . html
1 ||| also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and br mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) .
0 ||| what the hell is wrong with this thing .
1 ||| 9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
0 ||| - the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .
0 ||| yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet .
1 ||| in minutes i was easily navigating through the menus .
1 ||| i purchased this camera before it went on sale , and while i wouldn 't have minded keeping the extra $$$ , it was definitely worth it .
1 ||| their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific .
1 ||| there are instructions to encrypt your personal wireless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth .
1 ||| this did manage to cut the number of pop ups during start-up from 4 down to 2 .
1 ||| i still need to read up on some of the security settings , etc to fully understand all that 's up there , but bottom-line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the speed boost router .
1 ||| usb 2 . 0 transfer is insanely fast .
1 ||| the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .
1 ||| the program is called nomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows software does .
0 ||| no way to contact their customer service .
0 ||| after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it .
0 ||| linksys is more costlier than others and is a home/consumer division of disco .
1 ||| good color and very little needed to correct photos on paint shop pro .
1 ||| i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .
1 ||| with the right firmware , drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive .
1 ||| the more i work with it , the more i love it ! .
1 ||| i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
0 ||| so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it ! .
0 ||| 2 . you still have to clean the thing ! . ! .
1 ||| the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .
1 ||| transferring music is a breeze . i don 't subscribe to music services , but as mentioned on other reviews , micro allows you to subscribe to services other than itunes .
1 ||| this is a really great buy , for yourself or as a shower gift .
0 ||| ultimately you will learn just how bad nokia is , and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved .
1 ||| 8 . connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company von at 56k speed via bluetooth .
0 ||| you 'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once .
1 ||| this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
0 ||| it locked during install and i had to reformat the drive and start from scratch ( greer ! . )
0 ||| this one is particularly bothersome : allegedly one can use the zen micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another .
1 ||| it 's easy to use . not too small , and not too big .
1 ||| these include : mp3 , wave , wma , wma pro , and wma loss less ; . it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file ( s ) to be converted .
1 ||| like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .
0 ||| norton support is completely pathetic .
1 ||| i 've used the corporate edition at work without any problems ever .
0 ||| such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in . . . wrong ! .
0 ||| the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .
0 ||| -user 's guide doesn 't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website .
1 ||| t simply the best player on the market for a really low price , so why look anywhere else ? .
0 ||| the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .
1 ||| night mode is clear as day .
0 ||| but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on it have a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventually the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments .
1 ||| the creative zen micro , at first glance , is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers .
0 ||| f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the aesthetics bit down , of course
1 ||| the battery life seems good , takes very little time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .
1 ||| also , it takes any kitchen sized trash bag , so there is no special bag to stock .
1 ||| i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
1 ||| i am impressed with this camera inside and out .
0 ||| i already knew something was wrong , because much of the spam i 've seen in the past six months was from resellers of norton products .
1 ||| this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .
1 ||| the appearance is okay ed ( at least not ugly ) .
1 ||| supporting an operating system , symbian os , you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone .
1 ||| the thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome ! .
1 ||| learning how to use it will not take very long .
1 ||| the depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the m12v than it was on my old router .
1 ||| while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .
1 ||| since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , rivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
1 ||| overall , it 'll make my move that much easier knowing i don 't have to worry about connectivity .
0 ||| ) button sensitivity : even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting , the buttons are far two sensitive , really takes some getting use to , and even then , it is still too sensitive .
0 ||| when taking pictures of people , however , it shows every flaw in the subject 's skin .
1 ||| the extra spare battery is just a neat bonus .
0 ||| loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well .
1 ||| you just can 't go wrong with this one ! .
1 ||| i use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems .
0 ||| right now , the creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly .
1 ||| so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a hard drive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
0 ||| the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mils ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .
1 ||| and also , it 's priced very afford ably .
0 ||| i was using a motorola t720i with verizon and i had alot of dropped calls and i had troubles syncing data .
1 ||| i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .
1 ||| it all sounds great too .
1 ||| this is a great product , and canon has done an excellent job .
1 ||| the manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance ( but there is no manual focus or manual exposure ) .
1 ||| i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
0 ||| i took it out one day and the lcd was not working .
0 ||| if you buying this player to use with napster to go , wait a while .
1 ||| it works great .
1 ||| apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) .
0 ||| personally , i may never buy symantect products again .
0 ||| but if i installed either one of these norton products , neither works after installation ? .
1 ||| i really liked the price . . .
1 ||| while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .
0 ||| purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it .
1 ||| for the zen creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out , well presented and easy to open and put back together .
1 ||| but this camera is great ! .
0 ||| this is definitely one of those products , especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit .
0 ||| overall , a very disappointing product .
0 ||| i 've often struggled to get something to work the way i want it , and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time ! .
0 ||| * scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models .
0 ||| the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .
0 ||| it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ? .
1 ||| but that is good for me because symantec soft wares are a bit hard to master for me who are not savvy on computers .
0 ||| i read many reviews on norton i . s . 2004 from a variety of sources ( cnet , amazon , message boards ) and came to the conclusion that nis 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update .
0 ||| flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get over illuminated main subjects with depth being lost .
0 ||| they have a good concept here , and i normally expect a lot better quality from creative , so maybe they will do better with the next gen version , but for now i say buyer beware .
1 ||| i have set up it 's pda features with avaunt . com where you can download info from sites like weather , map quest maps/directions into it , which is great .
0 ||| i did have to cut off the ears that hold the template guide in place so i could get those big panel raising bits in it .
1 ||| - looks sleek , compact , has a radio .
0 ||| i just wished that it didn 't fill up so fast ! .
0 ||| - the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
1 ||| for the hobbiest , it 's probably a nice buy .
0 ||| i tried the cd setup program without any luck .
1 ||| another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
1 ||| the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
1 ||| my first impression was positive .
1 ||| honestly , i love this player .
1 ||| after comparing the included creative earbuds directly against my sony md-e828lp 's and sennheiser mx-400 's , i find myself still using the creative 's , which in my opinion , sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord .
1 ||| it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .
0 ||| the other thing i do n 't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .
0 ||| one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .
0 ||| but , all of this means nothing , because of the serious , serious , stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw : after 3 months , give or take a few weeks , you won 't be able to hear anything .
1 ||| it also costs a lot less than the ipod .
1 ||| i will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward , although you do need an external smut server to use .
0 ||| while transferring songs to the player , the interface has crashed a few times ( 4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period ) normally this would cause me major concern , but it appears that this bug is reproducible , which leads me to believe that creative will fix it with a patched version shortly ( or maybe it 's just my computer ) .
1 ||| big lcd screen - at least for me , 2 " is enough
1 ||| after getting used to the m12 all the rest seemed lacking .
1 ||| i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .
1 ||| range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
0 ||| i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept .
1 ||| but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it ! .
0 ||| i was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work , to no avail .
1 ||| the 6600 ( t-mobile ) is the true 'world phone ' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe , including new zealand and australia ( 900 ) whereas the 6620 ( available from singular ) replaces it w/ 800mhz ( some refer to as 850 ) .
0 ||| i had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the norton firewall vs . the windows firewall , and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because i did not have a " customer priority id number . "
1 ||| but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .
1 ||| - large easy readable screen
0 ||| so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out .
1 ||| let the champ win you over ! .
1 ||| anything this phone does , it does perfectly .
0 ||| one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .
1 ||| all the " cool " features of the mini , but with 20gb instead of 5 .
1 ||| you can use the player to store your computer data files ( good feature to have ) .
1 ||| 2 . battery life is over 4 . 5 hours , compared to about 2 . 5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikon's .
1 ||| applications : it has lots of applications and they work very well . . . when you eventually find where they are and they finally open .
1 ||| the bass is deep and the treble is clear .
0 ||| after some research on the net , i discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current wrt54g design ( wrt54g , version 3 , which amazon currently sells ) .
0 ||| first off , the battery .
0 ||| i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( laos angele's ) is horrendous .
1 ||| upon opening the box i was confronted with this small cute little mp3 player .
0 ||| norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products , but with this one , they have fallen off the cliff .
1 ||| second , the setup cd actually worked perfectly .
1 ||| i 'm sure i don 't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers , but i really like it ! .
1 ||| received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .
1 ||| i would recommend this camera unequivocally ! .
1 ||| on the t-mobile service i was able to take pics as we drove across i-70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a t-mobile tone ( usually a major city ) .
0 ||| i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .
0 ||| it it is a bit heavy for hand held work , but any router this size will be .
1 ||| i have tried other pails , but none have compared positively to the champ .
0 ||| i 'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops i jumped through ( emails , downloads , reboots , a purge and another download , plus reading through the help menu ) a refund should be twice as frustrating .
0 ||| nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software .
0 ||| other than that it is all the same except the new updates .
1 ||| it has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point-and-shoot we 've ever tested .
0 ||| also , diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston .
0 ||| norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer .
1 ||| if i could , i 'd trade-up on my creative muvo2 and snag a zen micro tomorrow .
0 ||| but be prepared to buy something else ( diaper genie ? . ) which can trap the odor better .
1 ||| if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket , take great pics and video , get the sd500 .
0 ||| also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .
1 ||| the design , as mentioned above , is sleek , cool and trendy ( and i think trendy = good , but it 's always hard to tell these days ) .
1 ||| it is very simple to import via photo 2 and then move them to photoshop .
1 ||| i must have gotten a good one .
0 ||| the volume .
1 ||| very good " every day " camera . fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos .
1 ||| it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .
